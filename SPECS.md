# Neuron Specifications

This directory contains the functional and technical specifications for the Neuron redesign (`redesign/v2`).

These specs are written to ensure the project is *composable by construction*: once the core is complete, the only remaining work to build a fully fledged local or distributed agentic system should be (1) technology-specific implementations (Temporal, Docker/K8s, Postgres, Vault, etc.) and (2) thin glue/configuration.

## How To Use These Specs

- Treat `specs/` as the durable source of truth for intended behavior.
- Each spec states what is already implemented in this repo and what is still required.
- Tests and examples should be added to prove each spec section.
