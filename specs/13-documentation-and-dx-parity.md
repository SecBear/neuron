# Documentation and DX Parity

## Purpose

Neuron must be teachable.

Documentation is part of core completeness because the architecture is only valuable if users can reliably compose systems out of it.

## Requirements

- A root README that describes the redesign and quickstart.
- A crate map that explains what each crate does.
- A small progressive tutorial series that builds up to multi-agent composition.
- Clear guidance on mock vs real path testing.

## Current Status

On `redesign/v2`, there is no root README.

There are deep architecture docs under `docs/architecture` and plans under `docs/plans`.

Still required for “core complete”:

- a user-facing entrypoint document set aligned to the current codebase
- examples that match docs
